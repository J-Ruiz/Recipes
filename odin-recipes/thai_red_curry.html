    <p>Thai red curry is a fantastic and fragrant dish that combines vegetables and meat into a delicious meat stew.
        Thai red curry has a reputation of being spicy, however feel free to use as little (or as much!) spice as
        you can handle. Thai curry is often served with white rice and eat as a main course. The beauty of the 
        dish comes in the flexibility of the ingredients. You should make the base sauce the same, however the 
        vegetables and meats you choose are always forgiving and blend in beautifully with the sauce at hand.

        <li>1 1/4 cups jasmine rice</li>
        <li>1 tblsp coconut oil (or olive oil)</li>
        <li>1 small white onion chopped</li>
        <li>A pinch of salt (more to taste)</li>
        <li>1 tblsp finely grated ginger</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic minced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper sliced (2 inch long strips)</li>
        <li>1 yellow, orange or green bell peper (2 inch long strips)</li>
        <li>3 carrots peeled and chopped into rounds</li>
        <li>2 tblsp Thai red curry paste</li>
        <li>1 can regular coconut milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of water</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of packed kale (remove ribs and stems)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons coconut sugar(or brown sugar)</li>
        <li>1 tblsp tamari or soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons rice vinegar or fresh lime juice</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>Steps <!--add a horizontal line-->
        <li>To cook the rice, bring a large pot of water to boil. Add the rinsed rice and continue boiling for 
            30 minutes, reducing heat as necessary to prevent overflow. Remove from heat, drain the rice and return 
            the rice to pot. Cover and let the rice rest for 10 minutes or longer, until you’re ready to serve. 
            Just before serving, season the rice to taste with salt and fluff it with a fork.</li>
        <li>To make the curry, warm a large skillet with deep sides over medium heat. Once it’s hot, add the oil. 
            Add the onion and a sprinkle of salt and cook, stirring often, until the onion has softened and is 
            turning translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 
            seconds, while stirring continuously.</li>
        <li>Add the bell peppers and carrots. Cook until the bell peppers are fork-tender, 3 to 5 more minutes, 
            stirring occasionally. Then add the curry paste and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk, water, kale and sugar, and stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer over 
            medium heat. Reduce heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer and cook until the peppers, carrots 
            and kale have softened to your liking, about 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat and season with tamari and rice vinegar. Add salt (I added ¼ teaspoon for 
            optimal flavor), to taste. If the curry needs a little more punch, add ½ teaspoon more tamari, or for 
            more acidity, add ½ teaspoon more rice vinegar. Divide rice and curry into bowls and garnish with chopped 
            cilantro and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, if you’d like. If you love spicy curries, serve with 
            sriracha or chili garlic sauce on the side.</li>
    </ol>
