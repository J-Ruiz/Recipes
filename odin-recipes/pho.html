    <p>Pho is a absolutely amazing Vietnamese soup dish. It combines herbs and spices into a broth and noodle soup
        often combined with various cuts of meat. Eaten on a cold winter day to warm up or a hot summer day to 
        cool down. Finish it with almost cooked thin sliced beef, beansprouts and jalapenos and let the hot broth
        finish the job for you while you wolf down this dish </p>

    <ol>Steps <!--add a horizontal line-->
        <li>Place a wire cooling rack or grill grate directly over the flame of a gas burner set on high. 
            Place onions and ginger on top and cook, turning occasionally, until deeply blackened on all sides, 
            about 10 minutes total. Alternatively, adjust oven rack to 3 to 4 inches from broiler element and 
            preheat broiler to high. Place onions and ginger on a foil-lined broiler tray. Broil, 
            turning occasionally, until charred on all surfaces, about 25 minutes total. Set aside. Place a wire 
            cooling rack or grill grate directly over the flame of a gas burner set on high. Place onions and
            ginger on top and cook, turning occasionally, until deeply blackened on all sides, about 10 minutes 
            total. Alternatively, adjust oven rack to 3 to 4 inches from broiler element and preheat broiler to 
            high. Place onions and ginger on a foil-lined broiler tray. Broil, turning occasionally, until charred 
            on all surfaces, about 25 minutes total. Set aside. </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine beef shins, oxtail, chuck, and brisket in a large stockpot. 
            Cover with cool water. Bring to a boil over high heat. Boil for 15 minutes, then dump water and meat 
            into sink. When cool enough to handle, rinse parts under cool running tap water, carefully scrubbing debris 
            off of any bones and out of cracks in the meat, then return them to the pot. Cover with cool water. </li>
        <li> Add charred onions, ginger, anise, cinnamon, fennel, cloves, coriander, fish sauce, sugar, and 1 
            tablespoon salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to a bare simmer, and cook, skimming 
            occasionally, until brisket and chuck are tender but not falling apart, about 1 1/2 hours. Transfer 
            brisket and chuck to a small bowl and cover with cold water. Refrigerate until ready to serve. </li>
        <li>Continue simmering broth for a further 4 hours, topping up with water as necessary. Strain broth 
            through a fine mesh strainer. If desired, pick meat and connective tissue from oxtails and beef shins. 
            Discard bones and aromatics. You should end up with about 4 quarts broth. Dilute with water or reduce 
            as necessary to reach 4 quarts. Keep hot. </li>
        <li>Carefully skim fat off of surface of broth and discard. Season broth to taste with additional fish 
            sauce, salt, and/or sugar. It should be highly seasoned. Slice cooked beef into thin slices or rough 
            chunks. </li>
        <li>Prepare pho noodles according to package directions. To serve, place re-hydrated noodles in individual 
            noodle bowls. Pour hot broth over noodles. Serve immediately, allowing guests to top with cooked meat 
            and slices of raw flank steak, herbs, aromatics, lime, and sauce as they wish. </li>
    </ol>
